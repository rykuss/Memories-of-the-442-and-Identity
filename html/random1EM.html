    <p id="filler">You decided to enlist, you were born in California and you are from a simple family of hard working farmers. You firmly believe that you are an American and you are not a big fan of the Japanese part of yourself: your parents wanted you to go to Japanese school to learn the language and the culture, but you hate it and want to speak English and hang out with American kids whenever possible. You are rather embarrassed that your parents are not very fluent in English.

In 1941, you joined the US military and you, hoping to serve your country honorably, are proud of yourself. Before leaving for the army, your family hold a family meeting, and your parents sternly tell you that you must always excel above others, that you must serve your country with great distinction and that you must never fear death but should always aim for glory</p>
