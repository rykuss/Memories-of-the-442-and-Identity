    <p id="question">The war is over, and you return back to your home in the mainland. Having experienced discrimination before the war, and fighting for your country during the war, you get to decide what you want to do now. Do you want to push for an apology from the government for their use of internment camps on your people? Or do you want to focus on gaining citizenship for Issei? Perhaps you donâ€™t care much about your ethnic struggle at all, and just want to focus on getting a good job?</p>
