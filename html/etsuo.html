    <p id="question">You have most identified with Etsuo Kohashi.  The son of a fisherman and born in the city of Hilo, Hawaii, he was known as “Etchan” to members of the 442nd Infantry Regiment.  A sergeant in Company K, he was known for carrying out daring reconnaissance work. Terrified of becoming a prisoner of war, he was especially afraid of the possibility of being sent to Japan and subsequently executed to the shame of his relatives (certainly an unlikely probability).  His uncle - a Russo-Japanese War veteran - told him to “come back dead” in order to assuage his worries about home and to better focus on combat.
