    <p id="question">The day is June 16th, and you start coming home a bit into the evening. You take the train home and think about the recent Pearl Harbor attack. While on the way back, you see a barbed wire fence high up, almost like a watchtower. It looks very similarly to the internment camps youâ€™ve heard about on the mainland, and your friends fear that they will be treated the same way. Do you accept that this is a part of living in your country, or do you become angry that you are treated like a foreigner, despite living in this country your entire life?</p>
