    <p id="question">As a Japanese-American born in California, you are currently incarcerated in a camp with your family. One day, a camp official came to you and offered you an opportunity to join the US army to fight the bad guys. You know that a good friend of yours, who just turned 20, signed up and went off to the War because he wanted to prove to other people that he was as American as anyone else and that he hoped to win honors for his country. Will you sign up and join the US military and fight for you country and people? If so, are you doing it to prove yourself and your loyalty, are you hoping to gain honor and glory for yourself and your family, or do you want to protect the United States from her enemies? Of course, signing up is completely voluntary and if you decide to stay clear, there will not be any repercussion whatsoever.</p>
