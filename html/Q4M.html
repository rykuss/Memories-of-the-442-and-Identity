    <p id="question">After weeks of intensive fighting, your veteran unit is finally advancing on Rome. Your unit was the spearhead of the drive toward the city and has taken heavy losses in the process. On the final advance into the city itself, your officers order you to move to the side in order to allow ‘regular’ army units to proceed first into Rome itself.  Do you feel offended/used, or neutral/not caring?</p>
