    <p class="question">You have most identified with Daniel Inouye. Daniel Inouye was a Nisei Japanese American from Honolulu. He was studying at the University of Hawaii, but quickly enlisted in the military after the ban on Japanese American enlistment was lifted. He performed excellent feats during the war, gaining a medal of honor, but lost his right arm during a battle. After the war, he began to focus studying politics. He became the first Hawaiian to have a seat in the House of Representatives. He also became the first Japanese American to serve in the Senate. He fought hard to preserve Japanese American rights, as he believed firmly that Japanese Americans could be just as loyal to their country as any other American.
