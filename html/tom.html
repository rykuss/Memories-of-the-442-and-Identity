    <p id="question">You have most identified with Tom Kawaguchi.  Born in Tacoma, Washington, he attended the University of Hawaii.  Interned at Camp Topaz, Utah, Tom was a patriotic volunteer to the 442nd who enlisted in part to erase his family’s perceived disgrace.  Pushed by the Japanese cultural values taught to Nisei as children to overcome his fear of death, he fought in both Europe and the Pacific.  Later he served in the occupation forces of both Germany and Japan.  Active in JACL, he also worked as an auditor.
