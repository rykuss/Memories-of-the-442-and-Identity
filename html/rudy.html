    <p id="question">You have most identified with Rudy Tokiwa. Rudy Tokiwa was born July  7, 1925 in Coyote, California. After spending some time in Japan and Manchuria, Tokiwa returned to California in 1939 and soon then graduated from Salinas High School. Following Americaâ€™s entrance into World War II, Tokiwa and his family were interned in Poston, Arizona. Rudy chose this tumultuous time to enlist, and became a member of the 442nd Infantry Regiment. He soon became known as a brave soldier who single-handedly captured a group of German soldiers. However, following the war Tokiwa became a major actor in the push for redress and reparations for what occurred to thousands of Japanese Americans after the attack at Pearl Harbor. Tokiwa administered his determined spirit in the 1980s to win out the battle for redress which became finalized in 1988.
