    <p id="filler">You decided to join up. As a part of the Hawaiian National Guard, you are a proud example of a Japanese American that fights to defend their homeland. You are a part of the 298th regiment, made up mostly of the residents of Oahu. You are even given a selective service number. Half of the force is made of Japanese Americans, just like you. You hope that your enlistment will help you gain recognition by your own country.</p>
