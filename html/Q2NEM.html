    <p id="question">After the attack on Pearl Harbor, you were pulled from college and sent to a relocation center.  Placed into the Heart Mountain camp, you are surrounded by conflicting opinions.  Some (JACL) say that this treatment by the American government is understandable or even justified and demands your open allegiance, while others (Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee) say you should not fight unless you are given back your rights as a citizen.  Do you; support JACL, support the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee, or do you remain neutral?</p>
