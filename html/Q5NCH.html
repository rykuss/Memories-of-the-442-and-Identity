    <p id="question">You’ve been ordered to join a banzai charge in an attempt to help save the lost battalion. This is a very dangerous mission, and you’ll be at the front line for the entirety of it. It is very likely that most of you will die during the charge. Despite this, it is your duty as an American soldier to accomplish this mission. Do you feel that this risk is worth your identity as a Japanese American, or do you feel outraged at the insane ordeals you are being forced to go through simply because your parents were Japanese?</p>
