    <p id="question">You've just finished Memories of the 442 and Identity! Congratulations! Whether you died, didn't enlist, lived to be a hero, believe your character Taro felt himself belonging to American Society, or believe he felt alienated from the very country he fought for, every result is based off of true events. Throughout the game, your answers have been registered and calculated to yield the Japanese American Veteran to related to most closely based on your opinions and actions. You will also be presented with a basic timeline where how you, Taro, felt he belonged in American society Before, During, and After the War. You may see a change of opinion reflected throughout this timeline and that's normal as people's perceptions, memories, and feelings change over time and through experience.
