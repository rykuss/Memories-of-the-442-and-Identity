    <p id="question">You have most identified with Stanley Akita. Stanley Akita was a third-generation Japanese American from Honomu, Hawaii. Akita was captured by German forces in the dense Vosges Mountains in France while attempting to bring wounded members of his unit to a hospital. He spent six months in Stalag-VII prison camp. Later in life Akita stated that the Japanese Imperial Army’s sudden attack on American soil was the best thing to ever happen to him as it caused him as well as other Japanese Americans to prove their worth to the American ideal.
