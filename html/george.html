    <p id="question">You have most identified with George Akiyama. In his youth, George was a son of farmers who worked on farms and orchards. At this time, he felt rather embarrassed because his parents could not speak English well, and, although like many Nisei students, he was ordered by his parents to go to Japanese schools to learn Japanese language, he did not like it and preferred to speak English even those schools. However, George said that he did appreciate the contributions made by his parents and thought that they taught him always to excel. He was drafted into the military in 1941, and his parents told him that he must serve honorably and must not be afraid to die for his country. Base on this, I would say that he and his family were very patriotic. Upon the outbreak of the War, his father was arrested by the FBI and was eventually imprisoned in Louisiana, while his family, although George was still serving in the military, was interned. During the war, he earned two citations for heroism, one a Bronze Star recognizing his “heroic disregard for personal safety” while helping to rescue the Lost Battalion in France. After the War, in 2001, George was publicly awarded in a large procession as a representative of Nisei veterans. He remained patriotic: he, in the ceremony, saluted the American flag and he wanted to remind people how patriotic they should be.
