    <p id="question">You have been placed into an active unit and finally away from the labor force you were forced into. You join the 442nd, a special Japanese-American only unit. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt approves of your battalion being a Japanese-American unit on February 1, 1943. While you feel honored to be in a regiment made up of your own people, most of the officers in the unit are actually white men. How do you feel about this? Are you offended that even in a Japanese American unit, outsiders are leading you, or do you not mind since it is the norm?</p>
