    <p id="filler">Moved from your home to the Heart Mountain Relocation Camp, you and your family live in poorly constructed (but electrically-powered)  barracks with 10,000 others.  Japanese-Americans provide most of the labor required to keep the camp going, and are not allowed to earn more than a private in the army - about 12-19 dollars per month.
