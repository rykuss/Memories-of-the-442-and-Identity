    <p id="question">You’ve been captive for a while now. You can’t even count the number of days you’ve been stuck in this camp. The food is awful, and the work is hell. You fought for a country that doesn’t even recognize you, and ended up a prisoner of war. Do you still feel that enlisting was the right choice? Does your loyalty to your country compel you to keep living and fighting, or do you at last give in and feel betrayed by your own country?</p>
