    <p id="question">You have most identified with Harry Kamikawa. Harry Kamikawa was born on the island of Oahu and enlisted in the U.S. army in March 1943 when he was 19 years old. His parents were laborers and he often missed school to help out at home -- to the point that he did not attend high school. Kamikawa saw the military as a way to escape poverty and his lack of opportunity without a high school education. During his training at Camp Shelby Kamikawa felt he and the other Japanese Americans were not wanted and remembered his time there as being trapped in a hell hole. However, by the time he finished training, he climbed up to Buck Sergeant status. Moreover, while in Italy Kamikawa was forced to lead his squad although he was younger than most of them. On October 22, 1944 Kamikawa was captured by German troops in France while assigned on a mission to re-supply elements to another unit. During the scuttle Kamikawa was the only soldier not to be wounded. He spent three months in a German POW camp until January 31, 1945 when Russian troops advanced towards Berlin. Although he and the other POWs were freed, they were not given supplies or directions by the Russian soldiers. He had to survive on potatoes found in fields in Poland and bread given to him in small villages. Upon his arrival back to Hawaii nobody in his family was alive to pick him up from port.
