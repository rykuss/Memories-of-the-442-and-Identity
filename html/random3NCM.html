    <p id="question">You charge forward with confidence, knowing that your honor as a Japanese American is at stake during this fight. With 8 men left total, 6 from the first platoon, and 2 from the second platoon, you manage to break through, and reach the lost battalion. The survivors of the lost battalion are thrilled to see you, regardless of your ethnicity, and you manage to successfully bring them back down the hill, saving multiple lives.</p>
