    <p id="filler">You are a brave fighter serving with distinction and honor. And you are fighting smart. Throughout the War you have never been seriously wounded nor have you ever been captured. In France, you participated in the operation to rescue the Lost Battalion, and, upon seeing a soldier being wounded, you had no regard for your own safety, but instead you immediately charged forth and successfully dragged the wounded fighter to safety. This earned you a Bronze Star recognizing your “heroic disregard for personal safety.” Eventually, you would earn another citation for you honorable and heroic service in the military.</p>
