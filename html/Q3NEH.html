    <p id="question">An enlistment draft begins in Hawaii. You are considering enlisting for the military. There are many reasons as to why you might do so. Perhaps you want to redeem your honor as an American? Do you want to simply defend your homeland? Or maybe your parents are encouraging you to prove your loyalty as a Japanese American by enlisting? However, the fear of war must also be considered, and you may not even want to sign up at all..</p>
