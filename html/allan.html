    <p id="question">You have most identified with Allan Ohata. Allan Ohata was born September 13, 1918 in Honolulu, Hawaii. He enlisted in the U.S. Army a month before Pearl Harbor in November 1941. Always known to be a determined child and young man, Ohata quickly earned the respect of his fellow soldiers and generals. Ohata was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery while staking out an uphill battle with enemy troops on all sides. When a fellow soldier nearby called for more ammunition, Ohata travelled 15 yards through raging machine-gun fire to help out, shooting down ten enemy soldiers in the process.
