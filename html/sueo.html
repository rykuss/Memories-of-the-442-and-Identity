    <p id="question">You have most identified with Sueo Fujii. Sueo Fujii was born in Kauai, Hawaii to parents who were Japanese farmers. Fujii quietly enlisted into the American army on March 23, 1943 without telling a word to his parents. He did not want outside views to contradict those of his own -- to serve and defend his home. As a medic in the 442nd Fujii saw the multitude of traumas during the war. His fellow medics could not handle what was an everyday occurance of pain and misery, and pushed more of the workload onto him, causing him further remorse against the war. Upon returning home to Hawaii following the war Fujii was told that his parents had faced multiple ransackings of his house by the FBI for his father’s participation as a soldier in the Russo-Japanese War. Late in life Fujii expressed discontent with the U.S. government’s involvement in blacklisting thousands of Japanese Americans. However, he was not regretful of his enlistment as it made the lives of millions of Japanese Americans more fruitful as their loyalty was finally proven.
