    <p id="question">You have most identified with Moe Yonemura. Moe Yonemura was a Nisei Japanese American who went to UCLA. He was one of the first to enlist in the military after the ban on Japanese American enlistment was lifted. He was known for being very active in school, and continued that even during his time at Heart Mountain. Unfortunately, he was shot and killed during the war, and was recognized by UCLA even after his passing. He represented Japanese Americans who were loyal to the country, and fought bravely in the war, but were killed in action.
