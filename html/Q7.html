    <p id="question">Itâ€™s been a long time since the end of the war. You fought hard, and managed to survive as a Japanese American soldier. While some still shun you in your own homeland, you know for a fact you fought with honor and loyalty for your country. Your parents can be proud of their succeeding generation. The very last thing you have to ask yourself though, was fighting in the war worth it? Did you feel like you did your part as a Japanese American by fighting in the war?</p>
