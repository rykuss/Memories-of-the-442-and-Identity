    <p id="filler">You’ve been captured. Due to your Japanese ancestry German soldiers are confused by your loyalty to a country that barely accepts you. They often ask you why you’ve enlisted on the side of the Americans. This is only the beginning of your thoughts. You’re also torn because of the Japanese perspective on getting captured in the first place -- that it is pitiable and shows a lack of commitment to your country. However, that is not how most Americans view it. You’re really a hero in their eyes. Keep your head up, soldier.</p>
