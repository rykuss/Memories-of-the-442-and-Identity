    <p id="question">You have most identified with Saburo Akiyama. Saburo, in his youth, felt that he was rather ashamed of being Japanese, that he wished he could be like white American children and that, in this respect, he felt quite disconnected with the United States, but, considering his parents’ education for him, he felt grateful and appreciated the parents’ sacrifice. He was still very young at this time, and so had no noteworthy achievement. Sab was incarcerated at Camp Minidoka, but this challenge actually promoted a sense of super-patriotism in him and allowed a sense of optimism, and so enlisted in 1944 immediately after turning 20 – he wanted to prove that “[the Japanese-Americans] are just as good citizens as everybody else … to be viewed as ‘super-American’”. In my opinion, Sab’s opinion concerning the United States changed somewhat: from feeling disconnected, he, at this point, was trying very hard to demonstrate his “American-nese”. Having returned from the war and later in his life, Sab did not participate in large-scale Japanese-American activism, but he did take up his pen to defend his fellow citizens and veterans. Rebutting an article in the Hood River News, he wrote that “we, the Nisei are natural-born citizens of the USA. This is our country – not our adopted country (which is a term the rebutted article used).” This writing of his also shows that, having survived the war and the incarnation, Sab still fiercely regarded himself as a citizen of the United State, just like he had done during the war. In short, it seems to me that Sab may have had one change of perspective, but it was rather minor: because of the incarnation, he reaffirmed his identity as a US citizen and reinforced his patriotism.
