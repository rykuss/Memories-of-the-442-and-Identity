Hello! Welcome to Memories of the 442 and identity!

To play, make sure all files have been extracted. That is, make sure it isn't zipped (which is how you downloaded it as).
Afterwards, open up the "frontPage.html" link directly below me. 

There are 13 total individuals that you can be matched with and there 
are many different paths you can follow, so make sure to replay!

To replay, simply reopen "frontPage.html". If there seems to be an issue 
running the game, reopen it in a new window(Not tab).

Have Fun!
